I chose the website shadertoy.com for part one. The URL for this website is: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsjXDm. This website caught my eye as it includes a lot of _simple_ shaders with accompanying code that can be copied and built upon allowing for quick learning of computer graphics. It also seems pretty easy to upload and share your own work to this website. There is a large selection of shaders that you can look at with the browse section having 7617 pages of shaders. This is a great website and I will be exploring more after completing this assignment.
